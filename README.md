## Why making this garbage?

I appreciate free software. Making your hard work available to everyone is very commendable. You participate to the whole heritage of humanity. I even myself only release my work under free licenses.
But calling something free, modifiable and redistribuable, while in reality, you prohibits those actions, except for private use, or except when you redistribute it with the exact same license (which you know is impossible in most cases, even when making real free softwares), is misleading.
This parody is just about rubbing salt in this wound.



## Is this a valid license?

Yes. It has the same terms than the `GNU GPL v3` (except `GNU` and `Free Software Foundation` were replaced).

However, this license is meant as a parody.
Especially, it emphasis the incompatibility of the terms of the GNU GPL with the GNU GPL itself, and the fact this makes it a proprietary software license, that surrenders your work to the FSF, rather than a free one, as it pretends to be.
If this is also your goal, you may add a suffix to the name of the license, so that it will also become incompatible with all others, while allowing you to claim it's free, and demonstrate this point even further (such as `GUN GPL LIBERTY PLUS` or `GUN GPL ABSOLUTE FREEDOM EDITION`).

If you release this license with another name, you need to change the first line of the license, with your chosen name. Do not worry about the license terms, however: A definition was added, so that `GUN General Public License` refers to your modified license, and not the original one.



## Can I legally use or modify this license?

I grant you all rights on the preamble of the GUN GPL license, including the right to re-use in another project, to redistribute it, possibly modified, blahblahblah and so on, without the need to credit my pseudonym, nor where you found it, but that would be much appreciated. You are responsible for what you do with it, however, I am not your mother.

For the license terms, [the FSF states "you can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license" (under conditions)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ModifyGPL). The GUN GPL meet those conditions.



## Contribute

If you have more humor than me, you can suggest changes to the preamble or instructions-for-use through pull requests. Do not change the terms of the license, however, it's intended to be the same as the GNU GPL.



## Legal Dislaimer

ANYTHING FROM THIS DOCUMENT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A LEGAL ADVICE, AND I CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY USE YOU MAKE OF IT.
IN ALL CASES, I AT LEAST HAVE THE FAIR RIGHT TO PARODY THIS LICENSE.
IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE GET OFFENDED FOR NOTHING, AND JUDGES ARE CORRUPTED, INCLUDING COUNTRIES THAT DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT, AND YOU FEAR A DEFAMATION TRIAL, YOU MAY WANT TO REMOVE THE PREAMBLE AND INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-USE FROM THE LICENSE.
PART OF THE PREAMBLE THAT MENTION SECTION 7 (AND PERHAPS NOT JUST THIS) MAY CAUSE PARTS OF THE LICENSE, OR THE ENTIRE LICENSE, TO BECOME INVALID, DUE TO THE ADMISSION TO THE WISH OF TRICKING THE USER. I ADDED A MENTION THAT THE PREAMBLE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE TERMS AND IS A PARODY, BUT IM NOT JURIST, IDK IF THAT COUNTS.
